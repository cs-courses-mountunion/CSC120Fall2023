<p><br/>Repetition is a powerful programming technique that allows us to process a large amount of data with just a few statements of Java code.&nbsp; This is one of the most important ideas that we will study in CSC 120, so we want to make sure you have a good idea of how repetition works.</p>
<p>Here is a video that demonstrates why repetition is useful and one of the Java statements that provides this capability:&nbsp; the <code>while</code> statement:</p>
