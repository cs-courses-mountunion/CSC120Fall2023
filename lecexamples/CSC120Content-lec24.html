<h2> CSC 120 Lecture # 24 Videos </h2>
<h3> Watch these videos in order from top to bottom: </h3>
<p><br/>Sometimes we will want to allow the user to enter numeric data in a TextField in our user interface, and have the program perform calculations with those numbers.&nbsp; This first video shows how to set that up, and the need for a way to convert String data to a numeric type.&nbsp; (Note: you can skip the first 4 minutes of this first video -- we have seen this in class before Fall Break)</p>

<p><br/>To convert String data to a numeric type in Java, we use the <code>Integer.parseInt</code> and <code>Double.parseDouble</code> methods.&nbsp; This next video demonstrates how that works.&nbsp; (Note: when this video was made, NetBeans didn't complain about the use of the <code>parseInt</code> and <code>parseDouble</code> methods, but now you can use <code>Integer.valueOf</code> and <code>Double.valueOf</code> as NetBeans will suggest).</p>

<p><br/>Another concept that is needed for Programming Assignment # 4 is finding the sum and average of a series of numbers that are entered one at a time by the user.&nbsp; Here's how that can be accomplished:</p>

<p><br/>In Programming Assignment # 4, you will build a user interface for the class definition you used in PA # 2, and calculate the sum and average of one of the numeric properties of your objects.&nbsp; Have fun and good luck!.</p>
